      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a comic artist but I came first in mathematics in high school so I figured my maths skills wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. I can&amp;rsquo;t say the same for my drawing skills. I was realistic and chose to major in mathematics and statistics at uni. I managed to get accepted to do honours then got a PhD scholarship offer. Lucky for me offers kept on rolling in and somehow I made it as a tenured/permanent position at Monash, where a group of people I admire work. Once I pass probation, I&amp;rsquo;m going to draw more (don&amp;rsquo;t tell my head of department). Currently, looking more into R internals and grid package so I can draw with code. It&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoys: drawing and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

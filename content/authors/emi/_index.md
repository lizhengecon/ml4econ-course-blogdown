I wanted to be a comic artist but I came first in mathematics in high school so I figured my maths skills wasn't bad. I can't say the same for my drawing skills. I was realistic and chose to major in mathematics and statistics at uni. I managed to get accepted to do honours then got a PhD scholarship offer. Lucky for me offers kept on rolling in and somehow I made it as a tenured/permanent position at Monash, where a group of people I admire work. Once I pass probation, I'm going to draw more (don't tell my head of department). Currently, looking more into R internals and grid package so I can draw with code. It's hard.  

Enjoys: drawing and coding.

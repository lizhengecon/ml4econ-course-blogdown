# An aside: about the structure of these slides

- This slide deck was created using the R package [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#44) (/ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/) and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Some slides include hidden comments. To view them, press __p__ on your keyboard

# Discussion forum

We will use a [GitHub discussion repository](https://github.com/ml4econ/discussion-spring2019). To use it, you'll need to create a GitHub account and ask for an invitations from Itamar.  

&lt;img src="figs/discussions.gif" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Google and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) are typically the first places to look for answers for computational related questions. It is safe to always assume that you are not the first one to encounter your problem.

Nevertheless, we will also be using a private GitHub repository for class discussion. Please post there any questions or requests you may have that are relevant to all course participants, rather than emailing us. All of your classmates will benefit from the public discussions.

You can access our GitHub discussion repository [here](https://github.com/ml4econ/discussion-spring2019), but before you do, make sure that you have created a GitHub account (see instruction [here](https://ml4econ.github.io/course-spring2019/git.html)) and that you have received a collaboration invitations from me (Itamar). Shoot me an email if you haven't received an invitation.

- Advanced course in econometrics.


- Some experience with R (or another programming language) are a plus.

.big[__About__]

How and when to apply ML methods in economics

  - estimate treatment effects
  - prediction policy
  - generate new data

To do that we will need to understand

  - what is ML?
  - How it relates to stuff we already know?
  - How it differs?

]

.big[__Not about__]

- Cutting-edge ML techniques (e.g., deep learning)

- Computational aspects (e.g., gradient descent)

- Data wrangling (a.k.a. "feature engeneering")

- Distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop, Spark)

# Programming language


* Two of the most popular open-source programming languages for data science:  

  - [&lt;i class="fab fa-r-project"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;](https://www.r-project.org/)  
  
  - [&lt;i class="fab fa-python"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Python](https://www.python.org/)  

* Our recommendation: R.  

* Why R? See presentation notes and the [FAQ section](https://ml4econ.github.io/course-spring2019/faq.html) of our class website.  

*  We do encourage you to try out Python. However, we will be able to provide limited support for Python users. 


???

__Why R (and not Python)?__

First things first, there is nothing that [R can do that Pyhton can't](https://www.quora.com/What-can-R-do-that-Python-cant) and [vice verca](https://www.quora.com/What-can-Python-do-that-R-cant). From our perspective, the main difference between the two is their purpose - Python is a general purpose programming language, whereas R was designed by statisticians (and a like) for statisticians. This means that R comes with thousands of built-in and user contributed libraries that help with statistical and econometric analysis. Python can do all that, but in many cases that are important to us, you'll need to code R procedures in Python from scratch.  

For instance, during this course we will make use of the [__causalTree__](https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree) and [__grf__](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf) R packages (created by Susan Athey et al.). These packages use trees and forests in order to estimate _heterogeneous_ treatment effects. __causalTree__ and __grf__ extend the popular __rpart__ R package, to deal with the task of of estimating causal effects. If you want to perform a causal tree analysis with Python, you'll have to program the whole thing by yourself. Though this could serve as a valuable exercise (and it even appears as an open [issue](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf/issues/257) in the __grf__ project repository), it is way beyond the scope of this course.

* DataCamp for the Classroom offer of high-quality, self-paced content and straightforward, easy-to-use interface for both students and instructors. In particular, enrolling to our ml4e DataCamp for the Classroom account will enable you 100% free access to all of DataCamp’s content, including their premium content.  

* One of your tasks in this course will be a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition. In this competition, you will rely on the “Boston Housing Data” to train and test machine learning models learned in the course. In particular, you will be required to apply the tools introduced in the course in order to predict the median house value based on a set of area specific housing market features. For more details, please visit the competition’s [website](https://www.kaggle.com/t/97eb0edcbe7c406882c7c067076bedd3).

# experimentdatar

We will also  make use of he [`experimentdatar`](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) data package that contains publicly available datasets that were used in Susan Athey and Guido Imbens' course ["Machine Learning and Econometrics"](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts) (AEA continuing Education, 2018).

- You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar/)
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itamarcaspi/experimentdatar")
```

- __EXAMPLE:__ Load the [`experimentdatar`](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) package and the `social` dataset:
```r
library(experimentdatar)
data(social)  
```
- Tips:  
  1. Runnig `?social` privides variable definitions.
  2. Running `dataDetails("social")` will open a link to the paper associated with `social`.

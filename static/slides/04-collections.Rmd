An <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> package...

--

that lets you create websites in 

<img src="images/RStudio-Logo-White.png" width = "15%">

???

So what is blogdown?

It is an R package... can I get a show of hands for everyone here who uses R? OK keep them up...

That lets you create websites in RStudio...can I get all of you R users to keep your hand up if you use RStudio, so lower your hand if you don't use RStudio

Perfect, thanks! So this is one of the first perks of blogdown, which is that you can build a website in the RStudio IDE using tools you are familiar with, and you won't need very much else to start.

![](images/hugo-themes.gif)


??? 

The package helps you to use a static site generator named Hugo. If you didn't understand much of the last sentence I said, that is OK! The main thing you'll want to know is that Hugo gives you over 100 themes to choose from, so you can create a custom-looking website, in the same way that Wordpress offers website themes.

One difference here is that you own your content, and the entire pipeline for creating it, from start to finish, which I think is a huge benefit to users. You control what, you control when, you control how.

# You can use R Markdown!



???

And a bonus is that because blogdown is built on top of R Markdown, you can include code and output in your website content.

This means you can include R code, but also Python, Julia, C++, any language engine supported in R Markdown.

This makes blogdown ideal for data scientists.

So what does a blogdown site look like?

For <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> users, why `blogdown` instead of [WordPress, Tumblr, Medium.com, Blogger.com]?

Some answers:

+ Own your content
+ Use R Markdown to create content (CODE CHUNKS)
+ Integrated within RStudio (my happy place)
+ Hugo themes
+ Is not Jekyll / PHP
+ Agnostic to publishing platform (= portable)

Let's start with the last thing you typically do to your home- decorate.

Open up the file `config/_default/params.toml`. Play with any of these configurations, but especially fonts/themes. You can see the ones designed by [Desir√©e De Leon](http://desiree.rbind.io/) in the `data/` folder.
